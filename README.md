# gCode utilities
This is a collection of scripts I plan to use to modify my gCode files before printing.
It's written in Typescript that I get more experience in the language. Maybe I implement this in Electron to get an GUI.

## Run tests
I also need to exercise writing tests, so I use a kinda TDD. To run the tests in watch mode, simply run:
```
npm test
```
